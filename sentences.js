/* =========================================================================
   sentences.js  —  Sentence Builder game data (Thai Beginner Course)
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   DATA ONLY. No logic lives here. Loaded BEFORE sentence-builder.js and AFTER
   the main inline script, so it shares the global scope (plain script, no
   modules). To add or edit sentences, edit THIS file only.

   Each record is SELF-CONTAINED:
     th[]   parallel array of Thai word-tokens (each becomes one tappable button)
     rom[]  parallel array of romanizations  (rom[i] matches th[i] by index)
     en     the English prompt shown above the puzzle
     less   lesson number (drives the Sentence Pool lesson chips)
     answers (OPTIONAL) array of acceptable word-orderings written as readable
             Thai token arrays. Absent => the canonical th[] order is the only
             correct answer. Present => player's arrangement is correct if it
             matches ANY listed ordering. Use only for genuinely different valid
             orders a native speaker would actually say.

   Answer checking is STRING-BASED (by displayed word sequence), never by which
   physical button — so duplicate words within a sentence are interchangeable
   automatically with no special handling.
